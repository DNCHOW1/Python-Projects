Simple game I tried to make with a hard-coded AI on a TIC-TAC-TOE board generated from strings. AI wasn't very good as it just chose random moves, but project would introduce me the concept of "MiniMax". Project helped me learn 2d arrays more in depth and gave me more experience in coding.

Project might need to be revisited but for the sole purpose of implementing the minimax algorithm and having it run efficiently. In addition, project was made with string formatting and string inputs for moves. Instead, with my insight in tkinter and pygame, I could now make a more visually pleasing and functional game.
