Grade Calculator I attempted to make to improve my use of functions and strings. It took in data from the class files as well as hard coded inputs for the test, quiz, and other grades and their associated weights in order to calculate the grade for the class.
In addition to this, I added the functionality to add more grades(name and classification), remove grades, and modify grades.

Trickiest part of this project for me was learning how to format the strings so that they would output nicely. It took a lot of trial and error, and forced me to navigate the documentation for more info about string methods.
Another tricky part was the regex, which took a couple of videos and reading to figure out the necessary combination of characters.


I think this project should be revisited sometime in the future. From reading the todo file, it's clear to me that there were a lot of ideas I couldn't implement at the time. However, now, with my expertise in all of the mentioned modules, I can definitely put this idea to better use. Moreover, it's something that would be useful with my uni classes in the future.
NOTE: Flask may be a good module to look into to try this
